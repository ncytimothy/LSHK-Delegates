# TextFieldDelegateStarter
* This is your chance to put your skills of the Delegation Pattern to good use! We are going to create a simple project for 3 different types ```UITextFields```

* [Meetup Link](https://www.meetup.com/Learn-Swift-HK/events/256112243/)

## App Description

-  The app should have 3  ```UITextFields```, the types (from top to bottom): Zip Code (5 numeric characters allowed only, but we are not validating for the valid zip codes), Dollar Sign Amount (similar to payment apps) 
- When the switch is "ON", the third textfields are editable (and hides keyboard when returned is pressed)
 - See the video to learn more about the flow
 
 ## Getting Started
 - The IBOutlets and interface have been built for you already, you just need to write the TextField delegates and IBActions to handle the requirements of the spec outlined in the video
 - You should start with creating each delegate, and then assign the delegate property of the textfield to each textfield
